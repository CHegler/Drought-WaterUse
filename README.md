# Drought-WaterUse
Drought and Water Usage in the USA

Drought means 'not enough water', true.
Drought is the Natural Disaster that stalks up silently. 
BUT I was surprised that my initial understanding was WAY off the real meaning. 
Follow along to see what I learned. 

What do you know about Drought? 

The data showed me that Georgia had more Drought than Arizona ... I was incredulous. Confused. Is the data wrong, I wondered? 
Turns out the data was excellent, I needed to learn more about how and what Drought was. This is about that journey and it is about finding ways to have enough water to live well now and in the future. 

My hope is that together we will find solutions, innovations and ways to save and reuse water. Water is Life, so my hope is that we will all have more life.
